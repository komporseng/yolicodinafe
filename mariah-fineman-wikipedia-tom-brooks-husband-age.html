So, what do we know about their relationship status? What about her divorce from her ex-husband?</p><p>Here, we address all the queries surrounding their relationship.</p><h3><strong>Mariah Fineman And Tom Brooks’ Relationship</strong></h3><p>After ending the relationship with Darcy Silva, Tom Brooks started searching for his soul mate while focusing on his writing. Then, he met his new girlfriend Mariah Fineman, a Las Vegas native. The couple went public with their relationship. However, fans weren’t very thrilled with the relationship for two different reasons.</p><p>The first reason was Mariah’s looks which were similar to Darcy and the second was her viewpoint on COVID-19 vaccines. After going public, Tom’s new girlfriend held a Q&A session with fans for 20 minutes. During the Q&A, one fan asked if she was vaccinated to which she replied “No way. My body. My right.” She shared that vaccines were poisonous.</p><p>Then, Mariah spoke about the natural remedies which angered her then 29,000 followers on IG.</p><p>One fan replied, “if that’s what you think, more power to you. Hilarious in my eyes. I think Ronald Reagan said it best: ‘A People Free to Choose.’</p><p>Not only that but the relationship between Tom and Mariah was also questioned for its authenticity. IG blogger RealityTeaVee addressed the rumor of their romance being fake. They were accused of being in a relationship to gain more publicity.</p><p>However, Tom Brooks denied the “fake relationship” gossip and decided to take matters into his own hands. Tom went live on IG and addressed the issue.

During the IG Live of Tom, Mariah’s husband Neil claimed that he loved her to death. But, the relationship took a different turn four years before when the relationship wasn’t the same anymore.</p><p>So they started processing for their divorce in mid-October 2020. But, SoapDirt reported that their divorce was canceled in August 2021.</p><p>Neil and Mariah made arrangements to co-parent their two sons and while working on a process to get divorced.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mariah claimed that she was a mother of three boys that means she also has another son from a different relationship.</p><h3><strong>Mariah Fineman Age</strong></h3><p>Appearing to be in her 40s as of 2021, Mariah Fineman hasn’t shared much about her age.</p><h3><strong>Mariah Fineman Before And After Plastic Surgery</strong></h3><p>It seems Mariah Fineman must’ve undergone several plastic surgery procedures to gain her current looks.
