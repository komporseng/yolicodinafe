His Family, Net Worth, Are You The One?</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Leo-Svete.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><span>When you’re sure that your other half is around you but you quite can’t figure out who, that’s when you get into a love triangle. Fortunately, Leo Svete, on</span><i><span> Are You The One</span></i><span>, chose Brooke in the first match-up ceremony, and the feelings were reciprocated — leaving Will in dismay.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this “Leo Svete Bio” to learn more about him.</span></p><h3><b>Leo Svete On Are You The One?</b></h3><p><span>The wait is over! </span><i><span>Are You The One?</span></i><span> is back for its ninth installment after a four-year hiatus. Once again, 22 contestants from around the world are coming together to find their compatible half, and our star, Leo Svete is one of them.</span></p><p><span>“Last year when I had nowhere turn going through tough times in my life, I took a chance at finding love and hoping to win 1 million dollars,” Leo talked a little about why he joined the show.</span></p><p><span>For those whose memory needs a jog (or if you’re completely new to the show), every contestant on the show must go through extensive interviews and compatibility tests before filming. Thereafter, the show uses a special matchmaking algorithm tool to ensure all contestants have a “perfect match.” So, the goal is to figure out who they are destined for through a “truth booth.”</span></p><p><span>If the group can figure out every true match in 10 or fewer attempts, they get to split a $1,000,00 prize. However, each time the contestants fail to figure out any new matches, the winnings are cut in half.</span></p><h3><b>Leo Svete Relationship Status</b></h3><p><span>Leo Svete claimed to be “single” as of 2023. Or at least that was what his FB profile mentioned. So, could this mean that Leo and Brooke Rachman didn’t make it out of the show?</span></p><p><span>Looking back, Leo first caught Brooke’s attention because of his height. However, he wasn’t the only one Brooke liked. She also was flirting with Will who told her that he was looking for someone supportive. In response, Brooke said to him, “I need someone who is literally obsessed with how I am,” she told him. And that was Leo!</span></p><p><span>Leo and Brooke first bonded over their experience with their dad’s health and spent even more time together after that talk.</span></p><p><span>Seeing this, Will pulled Brooke aside to talk in the second ep and complained “I made a joke earlier and you gave me a dirty a** look. I was like, ‘Geez save some for the rest of us.’.”</span></p><p><span>Again, Brooke reassured him, “I’m not mean, I promise!” She even hinted that&nbsp; Will would be her number one if he was nicer.</span></p><p><span>But ultimately, in the first match-up ceremony, Leo picked Brooke as he dipped her back and kissed her. Flustered, Brooke said, “I came into this not thinking I was going to crush on someone so hard so fast.”</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Will said he felt like he was only Brooke’s shoulder to cry on when Leo wasn’t giving her attention.</span></p><p><span>Before appearing on </span><i><span>Are You The One</span></i><span>, Leo was in a relationship with a lovely lady who’s heavenly featured on his FB. The two officially began their relationship in December 2020 and ended it before 2022.</span></p><p><span>Their last pic together was taken in July 2021.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is Leo Svete?</b></h3><p><span>Leo Svete was 30 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>Are You The One?</span></i><span> in 2023.</span></p><p><span>However, he was a year younger when he actually started filming the show.</span></p><h3><b>Leo Svete Family</b></h3><p><span>Leo Svete comes from a family of four.</span></p><p><span>His father, Lee Svete is the “Director of Career & Professional Development” at </span><i><span>Emory & Henry College</span></i><span>, and the former “AVP of the Office of Personal Career & Professional Development” at </span><i><span>Wake Forest University</span></i><span>.

However, she also excels in studies and has a double Major in Biology Pre-professional and Psychology. The last we checked, she was a Psychiatry resident at the </span><i><span>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>Explaining his relationship with his sister, Leo said, “Just got off FaceTime with my sister that was an hour and ten minutes long. It is such a blessing to have such an amazing relationship with Lily Svete who I call my best friend. She makes me a better person and has accomplished everything you can imagine!”</span></p><p><span>Sadly, Leo’s grandparents, Leo Joseph and Elizabeth Svete, both passed away in 2013.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Leo Svete Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Leo Svete garnered a net worth of under $300 thousand by 2023.</span></p><p><span>This reality star is a Professional Basketball Player, Elite skills trainer (owner and CEO of </span><i><span>Svete Select Training</span></i><span>), and Motivational Speaker.
