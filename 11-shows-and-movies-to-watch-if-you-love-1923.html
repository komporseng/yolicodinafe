Quickly following the praise for the show, Sheridan created two prequels: 1883 and 1923. Both have been extremely successful and well accepted, but there’s something special about 1923 and the cast that makes up the previous Duttons. Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren play Jacob and Cara Dutton, giving us some major backstories to how the Dutton ranch came to be. If you’re a fan of the show and are looking for something similar, this list contains 11 movies and series that you should give a try.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Helen Mirren Reveals What Motivates Her Character in 1923</a></span></p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>MOVIEWEB VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong><h2 id=succession><span class=item-num>11</span> <span>Succession</span></h2><figure>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Warner Bros.

There’s something addicting about watching a family fight on screen, whether it’s relatable or entertaining, and the Roy family has loads of baggage for you to unpack. There are several characters that are somewhat likable, like cousin Greg, and you’ll find yourself wanting to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">be part of the drama</a>. Logan Roy is like a swanky East Coast version of every male Dutton, not one to wield a gun but instead a silver tongue.</p><h2 id=peaky-blinders><span class=item-num>10</span> <span>Peaky Blinders</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/peaky-blinders-brothers.jpeg><p>You might need to turn on the subtitles for the Netflix show <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Peaky Blinders</strong></a>; the characters’ thick Birmingham accents make it hard to understand what they’re saying. The Shelby family is well-known throughout England, with The Peaky Blinders gang threatening to make themselves known or else. Thomas Shelby isn’t the oldest of his siblings, but <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he’s the most feared and respected</a>, as he spreads terror across the country. Powerful family dynamics, murder, and constant love interests coming and going will have you sucked in. By the time you reach the finale, you’ll be missing the Shelby family and all the nightmares that come with them.</p><h2 id=no-country-for-old-men-2007><span class=item-num>9</span> <span>No Country for Old Men (2007)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/No-Country-for-Old-Men-(2).jpg><p>This stacked cast features stars such as Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Woody Harrelson, and more. <strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">No Country for Old Men</a></strong> is a bit different from other westerns in that it focuses on a botched drug deal and two million dollars left on the side of the road. While it has its differences, it also plays into the authenticity of a good western, pulling inspiration from older films and giving the audience what they want: men fighting on horses. There’s plenty of violence, drugs, and glimpses of family dynamics that are familiar to fans of the Yellowstone universe.</p><h2 id=1883><span class=item-num>8</span> <span>1883</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1883.jpg><p>1923 was created after the success of its predecessor, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>1883</strong></a>, the limited series following the Duttons on a wagon-train trail as they try to find a spot to settle down. It’s ten episodes of traveling, Dutton dynamics, and Sam Elliot being the best cowboy ever. It’s a great series to watch if you’re interested in the history of the Duttons before John and his gang came along. It’s interesting to see how they settle in the Montana mountains, which will eventually <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">evolve into the Yellowstone Ranch</a>.</p><h2 id=dances-with-wolves-1990><span class=item-num>7</span> <span>Dances with Wolves (1990)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kevin-costner-dances-with-wolves.jpeg><p>A young Kevin Costner starred, directed, and produced <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Dances With Wolves</strong></a>, a western that had a budget of $15 million and made over $400 million at the box office.

In <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Godless</strong></a>, the miniseries focuses on a mining town run entirely by a group of strong women who are more than capable of existing without a man trying to take over. Jake O’Connell and Jeff Daniels appear on the show, but you’ll be more interested in hearing about the stories of the women than anything else.</p><h2 id=outer-range><span class=item-num>5</span> <span>Outer Range</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/brolin_outer_range_2022.jpg><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Outer Range</strong></a> is another modern Western that makes you wish you could ride a horse off into the sunset, but a different factor of this Amazon series is the supernatural element.

Josh Brolin leads this show with great pacing and chemistry <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">with his cast mates</a>: Lili Taylor, who plays his wife Cecilia, and his sons in the show, Perry (Tom Pelphrey) and Rhett (Lewis Pullman).

Chris Pine and Ben Foster star in this Western-esque drama about two brothers who pull off a bank heist in order to save their family ranch. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Hell or High Water</strong></a> is full of everything you love about a western: strong family ties, heavy accents, Jeff Bridges, and more. Sheridan found his footing with the genre with this movie and went on to create multiple series that we know and love.</p><h2 id=let-him-go-2020><span class=item-num>2</span> <span>Let Him Go (2020)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/costner-and-lane-let-him-go.jpg><p>Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are downright electric in this suspenseful western film that has so many heart-stopping moments it’s almost painful. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Let Him Go</strong></a> is based on the novel of the same name written by Larry Watson and centers around a retired sheriff and his wife who mourn the loss of their son and set out to rescue their ex-daughter-in-law and grandson. The family their daughter-in-law has gotten mixed up with is dangerous and lives off the grid, posing threats to the child and also the daughter.

The Duttons are the most powerful family in the state of Montana, especially the head of the household, John Dutton. Through each successful season, the Duttons face a huge problem that requires many people to die in order to solve it, but John’s right-hand man, Rip Wheeler, always makes sure the family is protected. Yellowstone is one of the best <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">modern westerns on television right now</a>, staying true to traditional stories while also incorporating modern retellings. You’ll be sucked in with the first episode, and soon enough you’ll be wishing you could be part of the Dutton Ranch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGhoamWjnby4v4yapZ1lnaTDqrHSZquoZaeWwaS0jKKdZrGfqnqtu9WeZGpxYmh8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-pickleball-hard-on-your-knees-debunking-the-myths-and-exploring-the-facts.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Pickleball Hard on Your Knees?
