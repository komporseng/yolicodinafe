It’s challenging not to fume with jealousy, so behold. Here is Eiza González’s boyfriend list, everyone she’s dated and was rumored to have dated. Hence, enjoy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Pepe_Diaz></span>Pepe Diaz<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mexican actress, Eiza and Brazillian businessman <strong>Pepe Diaz</strong> dated for a couple of years in 2011. The former lovers were open about their relationship and often gushed their affection via social media.</p><p>However, Eiza and her ex-boyfriend called their romance off in 2013. The Sueña Conmigo actress confirmed their breakup via social media post in August, claiming they separated more than a month ago. However, Eiza further cleared that she was happy to close the cycle for another incredible one.</p><p>Interestingly, Eiza and Pepe had broken their relationship on different occasions, but they seemed to have mended it until it was beyond repair.

In addition, she was heard assuring Jorge was very bad in bed. Sounds typical, eh? Well, Eiza’s reps <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">confirmed that the recording</a> was manipulated. They further emphasized that the Eiza did not have anything to do with Jorge, and the audio was not directed towards Pepe’s brother.

However, the spark was short-lived as Liam ended up reconciling with Miley in 2016.</p><p>On the other hand, Eiza refuses to talk about the relationship as she claims it unnecessary. Moreover, she sounded rather irked when she compared her ‘public figure’ circumstances with the school. She further explained that people know each other, and she’s linked to people because it’s her environment.</p><p>Gonzalez also seemed confused why her life choices and circles were such a big thing. Nevertheless, she moved on from the Australian actor happily.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=DJ_Cotrona></span>D.J.
