This groundbreaking discovery was announced by the University of the Witwatersrand, the National Geographic Society, and the South African National Research Foundation, and published in the journal eLife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698724887_586_Scientists-uncover-evidence-showing-mysterious-human-species-buried-their-dead.jpeg><p>The Homo naledi fossils were initially discovered in the Rising Star cave system in South Africa during excavations in 2013. This cave system is part of South Africa’s Cradle of Humankind, a UNESCO World Heritage Site where numerous ancient human ancestor species’ fossils have been found, shedding light on the story of human evolution.</p><p>Dr. Lee Berger’s team found Homo naledi adults and children buried in the fetal position within cave depressions, a practice that predates any known Homo sapiens burials by at least 100,000 years.</p><p>During the investigation of the cave burials, the scientists also uncovered symbols carved on the cave walls, estimated to be between 241,000 and 335,000 years old, and are undergoing further testing to determine a more precise dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Scientists-uncover-evidence-showing-mysterious-human-species-buried-their-dead.webp.webp><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1698724888_781_Scientists-uncover-evidence-showing-mysterious-human-species-buried-their-dead.webp.webp><p>These symbols, including hashtag-like cross-hatchings and geometric shapes, were similar to the ones carved by early Homo sapiens and Neanderthals, used as a way to record and share information.</p><p>Lead author of two of the studies and coauthor of the third, Berger, stated, “These recent findings suggest intentional burials, the use of symbols, and meaning-making activities by Homo naledi. It seems an inevitable conclusion that in combination they indicate that this small-brained species of ancient human relatives were performing complex practices related to death.”</p><p>“That would mean not only are humans not unique in the development of symbolic practices, but may not have even invented such behaviors.”</p><p>The team has currently mapped over 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) of the caves, requiring bravery due to the cave system’s dangerous features, as explained by lead geologist Dr. Tebogo Makhubela, and National Geographic Explorer and lead excavator of Dragon’s Back Expedition, Dr. Keneiloe Molopyane.</p><p>Berger shared the challenges of exploring the cave chambers, which ultimately led to his significant weight loss to enter the cave in 2022.</p><p>“It was the most awful and wonderful experience in my life,” Berger said. “I almost died coming out of there, but it was obviously worth it to make some of these discoveries. But, I think an important part of that, though, is that the journey would not be nearly as difficult, I think, for Homo naledi.”</p><p>Homo naledi’s physical characteristics included similarities to humans, such as walking upright and manipulating objects by hand, though they had smaller heads, shorter stature, and a more robust build. Their shoulders and teeth shared similarities with earlier hominins like Australopithecus, as noted by Dr. John Hawks, professor of anthropology and paleoanthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p><p>As the team delved deeper into the caves, it became evident that Homo naledi was well-acquainted with and utilizing extensive parts of the cave system.</p><p>The discovery of Homo naledi in 2015 raised the possibility that the species intentionally disposed of their dead in the cave, though controversial due to their small-brained nature. However, in 2018, evidence supporting this idea emerged when the scientists found ovals carved into cave surfaces resembling holes, with bodies placed inside in a curled position—a truly astonishing revelation.</p><p>“It’s not a body that died in a depression or hole. It was a whole body that was covered in dirt and then decayed within the grave itself, in part demonstrating that it was buried at the time as a whole flesh entity, but not by some dramatic collapse or being washed in,” Berger explained.</p><p>“We feel that they’ve met the litmus test of human burials or archaic human burials and the most ancient human burials, and therefore describe them as graves or burials by the nonhuman species, Homo naledi.”</p><p>Subsequently, an artifact was found within a burial, and carvings on the wall were discovered.</p><p>While the meaning of the symbols remains unclear and it is uncertain whether they served as a form of language or communication within the species, the intentional creation of geometric designs attests to the significant effort and risk taken by Homo naledi, as explained by Fuentes.</p><p>“The challenge here, then, is that we now know that Homo naledi, in addition to Homo sapiens and Neanderthals and Denisovans and a few others, were engaging in the kind of behavior that we, even just a few decades ago, thought was unique to us,” he said. “That means we need to rethink the timing of fire use, of meaning-making and of the burial of the dead in hominin history.”</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiqnKGVo8Gqv9OsZJ%2Bhnpl6sb7OqJ1mrJiWwW6tzZygnqakYrW2ucCnZKyolZi2pr%2BMm6yroZWZerW0xKKpZpyVmLKiv8SdZJqmlGKwor7Vnptmq6mir7C40mZoaWhgZX1uxcSaqaxlkpqzsL7EZqSonJWnu2601KaYp6tdqLKmec%2Bhpq2no2Q%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./index-php.html>&#171;&nbsp;Vital Spirit (ability) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a>
